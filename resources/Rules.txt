Click on the "Start new game" button to start a new game. The number 1 
will appear on the screen in the upper-left corner. 

When you remember where the number 1 is, click on the button "Click 
here when you are ready". All fields will be filled with 0, and then you 
need to click on the field where was number 1 (upper-left corner). If 
you have completed these steps, you have successfully moved to level 2. 

At level 2, the first 2 fields will be filled with numbers 1 and 2 in 
random order. To go to level 3, you must first remember in wich order 
they appeared, then click the "Click here when you ready" button again,
and then click on fields 1 and 2 in the appropriate order. On each 
subsequent level, one more field will be filled with a random number,
up to a maximum of level 30. 

In case you have not clicked on the fields in the appropriate order, 
the message "Game over" will appear in the lower-right corner. Also, in
the lower-right corner, there is a field where you can enter your 
username, and the best result can be seen in the "High score" tab.
